# gematriagui
<h1>Thanks for coming across my project. </h1>

This is a simple program that adds up gematria of Hebrew words. 
<br/>
This is based off a project that I made that adds up the gematria of Hebrew words, but was command line based, and this has a GUI to it. 
<br/>
In order to run the program from command line and have it open up the GUI, download the gematriagui.jar file, then open up a CMD/Terminal, then type in 
<br/>
java -jar /path/gematriagui.jar
and with backwards slashes for windows. 
<br/>
This is what the program looks like once it is open, and the user has entered something to get the gematria of.
